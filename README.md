# Learning Programming Language X

This repo is organized into different sections which will act as little exercises to do when learning a new programming language.  I'm using it to learn rust but the tasks will be general and apply to all languages (some more than others).

## Install X = Rust

[Official installation instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Tasks

### String Manipulation

Write a function to count the number of vowels in a given string.
Implement a function to reverse each word in a sentence while keeping the word order intact.
Create a program that converts a given string to title case (capitalizing the first letter of each word).

### Vector and List Operations

Write a function to add two vectors of the same length element-wise.
Implement a function to find the dot product of two vectors.


### [Data Visualization](./tasks/visualizations/)

Plot a line graph of the sine and cosine functions on the same set of axes.
Create a bar chart showing the frequency of each character in a given string.
Generate a scatter plot from a list of tuples representing (x, y) coordinates.

### File I/O

Write a program to read a CSV file and calculate the average of a specific column.
Implement a function to merge the contents of two text files into a third file.
Create a script that reads a JSON file and prints out all the keys and values.

### Basic Math Operations

Write a function to find the factorial of a number using recursion.
Implement a program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.
Create a function to solve a quadratic equation given its coefficients.

### Control Structures

Implement a program that prints the first 100 prime numbers.
Write a script to simulate a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
Create a function to check if a given number is a palindrome.

## Database Operations

Write a program to create a SQLite database and insert some sample data.
Implement a function to retrieve and display all records from a specific table.
Create a script to update a record in a database based on user input.

### Concurrency and Parallelism

Write a program to download multiple files concurrently using threads.
Implement a script to perform matrix multiplication in parallel.


### Error Handling and Debugging

Write a function that performs division and handles division by zero gracefully.
Implement a script that reads a file and handles file not found errors.
Create a program with intentional bugs and practice using a debugger to find and fix them.

## Extra Credit

### API Interaction

Write a script that fetches weather data from a public API and displays it in a user-friendly format.
Implement a program to fetch and display the top headlines from a news API.
Create a script to post a message to a social media platform's API (e.g., Twitter).

### Memory Management

Write a program to allocate and free memory for an array dynamically.
Implement a function to create a linked list and perform basic operations (insert, delete, traverse).
Create a script to simulate memory leak detection in a program.

### Functional Programming

Write a function to filter a list of numbers and return only the even ones using a higher-order function.
Implement a script that uses map and reduce to calculate the sum of squares of a list of numbers.
Create a program that sorts a list of strings by their lengths using a lambda function.
